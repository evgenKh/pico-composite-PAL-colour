write directly into the buffer as it's being read by DMA
    (ie remove page swap)

do the copy while the porches go?
(calculate while the other line is sent)

do the copy at the tail end of sending the colour data/front porch?


can you copy tbuf to the buffer without the delay?


how much time does the calculation really take?

dma_channel chaining?
    channel_config_set_chain_to()
at the end of the dma transfer the next transfer is handled by a different dma?
could use two DMAs chained to compute two scanlines at once

^ this isn't working - the data is split up, but the chain doesn't chain



issue with copying RAM quickly
seems like it might be something to do with SRAM banking?


banks?
manually specify banks
__scratch_x
doesn't seem to be helping, am I missing something?

the rgb to yuv pre conversion isn't quite working right
    negative u/v values?




maybe better throughput using the second core for processing to lines?

somework on one core some work on the other?
iterrupt/signal to the other core?



clocked to fast to access flash memory?

test with regular pico and same DAC
test with pico in regular vga board DAC
