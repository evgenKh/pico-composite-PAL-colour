explicitly write out inner loop
a bunch of individual ints for the sin/cos?


how much time does the calculation really take?
    it seems like the SIN[] and COS[] array access is what's killing the speed?


15 pixels for the looping of the carrier, seems like working from the shorter array is marginally faster


30 samples/pixel?
use dma to copy the 15 repeating pattern?


sin wave already in backbuffer, then +=?





2 bits each for y/u/v isn't brilliant



somework on one core some work on the other?
iterrupt/signal to the other core?



test with regular pico and same DAC
test with pico in regular vga board DAC
