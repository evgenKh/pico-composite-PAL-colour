dma_channel chaining?
    channel_config_set_chain_to()
at the end of the dma transfer the next transfer is handled by a different dma?
could use two DMAs chained to compute two scanlines at once


one dma for frontport hsync and backporch, one for the rest?



issue with copying RAM quickly
seems like it might be something to do with SRAM banking?


banks?
manually specify banks

maybe better throughput using the second core for processing to lines?

somework on one core some work on the other?
iterrupt/signal to the other core?



clocked to fast to access flash memory?

test with regular pico and same DAC
test with pico in regular vga board DAC
