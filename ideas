===

do proper PAL 50i rather than 25p?
    what keeps some digital adapters from working?

code clean up
    buffer class
    options for x,y of demos on screen & their sizes

double the y-resolution by using 4 bits then 4 bits?
double x by changing the # of samples per pixel, and then switching to 2 bits per y/u/v?
    or by setting up the buffer class with individual arrays for y, u, and v?

some sort of auto figuring out the correct DAC frequency?
    (fine tuning buttons?)
