remove lines, just have a really long colour burst at a low freq

run at a low carrier frequency and use the picoscope

try changing system clock and see if reproduced frequency changes

check if the rising (not -0.3 bit) of the composite signal has the correct length
the 66 vs 64 us time difference could just be tacked onto the end while the code shuffles



===

it seems like a clock divider of 2 stretches things a bit
and odd/prime number dividers cause the signal to be malformed
