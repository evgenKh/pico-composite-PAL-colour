still not quite right on a digital set
    seems to be working with a 266 system clock and /4 divider

use pio nops to create different timings?
    /3 could be done, but didn't seem to really help (maybe got it to help once..., but couldn't reproduce)



i wonder if this might be working because it's a little cooked from so much overclocking?
when plugged into some usb ports the tiny2040 is no longer detected
