slightly faster to read from RAM x3 than to do the bit shifts for yuv? (10%)
so store in yuv? 
84x125 anamorphic
effective & actual xresolution?
yes shows more, but not as much as I hoped
    58 out of 84 pixels
    could go 3 to 1 anamorphic (56x84?), but such low detail :(



it seems like array access is what's killing speed

30 samples/pixel?
use dma to copy the 15 repeating pattern?



while loop?


test with regular pico and same DAC
test with pico in regular vga board DAC



=====

some recorded timings...

for 39 loops:
explicit: 54 us
looped: 41 for
currentline instead of array lookup: 11.5
pointer method: 41 us
bitshift instead of division: 35
bitshift with and instead of division: 35
bitshifts and square sine and taking out whitelevel: 37
squaresine same speed as proper sine
memset blanks then +=: 45
taking the assumed division by 128 for levelwhite out and adding levelblank to take level white out of the brackets
^^^ that: 32.5 us
sequential interleaved sin/cos: 33 us
y=u=v=currentline: 4.2us
^^that and sin&cos = currentline: 1.9 us


24 us doing the porches
3.2 us of that is the dma copy
